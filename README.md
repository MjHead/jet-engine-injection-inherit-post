## Description

Plugin allows you to inhert post object from listing item context for static listing item injections.

By default static listing item injection has the same post context as next listing post. So you can't use dynamic widgets or tags in static injections.
With this plugin listing grid will iterate through posts from post type which is set in injected listing item settings.

## Settings
- Inherit post object - enables getting post object from injected listing item context
- Infinity loop - if you have less injected posts than regular listing grid posts, you can enbale this option to repeat injected posts until main listing grid end
